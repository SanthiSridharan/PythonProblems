Regular expressions
Exercise 0 hints at the general problem of finding patterns in text. A handy tool for this problem is Python's Regular Expression module, re.

A regular expression is a specially formatted pattern, written as a string. Matching patterns with regular expressions has 3 steps:

You come up with a pattern to find.
You compile it into a pattern object.
You apply the pattern object to a string to find matches, i.e., instances of the pattern within the string.
As you read through the examples below, refer also to the regular expression HOWTO document for many more examples and details.

import re
Basics
Let's see how this scheme works for the simplest case, in which the pattern is an exact substring. In the following example, suppose want to look for the substring 'fox' within a larger input string.

pattern = 'fox'
pattern_matcher = re.compile(pattern)

input_string = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
matches = pattern_matcher.search(input_string)
print(matches)
<re.Match object; span=(16, 19), match='fox'>
Observe that the returned object, matches, is a special object. Inspecting the printed output, notice that the matching text, 'fox', was found and located at positions 16-18 of the input_string. Had there been no matches, then .search() would have returned None, as in this example:

print(pattern_matcher.search("This input has a FOX, but it's all uppercase and so won't match."))
None
You can also write code to query the matches object for more information.

print(matches.group())
print(matches.start())
print(matches.end())
print(matches.span())
fox
16
19
(16, 19)
Module-level searching. For infrequently used patterns, you can also skip creating the pattern object and just call the module-level search function, re.search().

matches_2 = re.search('jump', input_string)
assert matches_2 is not None
print ("Found", matches_2.group(), "@", matches_2.span())
Found jump @ (20, 24)
Other Search Methods. Besides search(), there are several other pattern-matching procedures:

match() - Determine if the regular expression (RE) matches at the beginning of the string.
search() - Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches.
findall() - Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list.
finditer() - Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator.
We'll use several of these below; again, refer to the HOWTO for more details.

A pattern language
An exact substring is one kind of pattern, but the power of regular expressions is that it provides an entire "mini-language" for specifying more general patterns.

To start, read the section of the HOWTO on "Simple Patterns". We highlight a few constructs below.

# Metacharacter classes
vowels = '[aeiou]'

print(f"Scanning `{input_string}` for vowels, `{vowels}`:")
for match_vowel in re.finditer(vowels, input_string):
    print(match_vowel)
Scanning `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` for vowels, `[aeiou]`:
<re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='e'>
<re.Match object; span=(5, 6), match='u'>
<re.Match object; span=(6, 7), match='i'>
<re.Match object; span=(12, 13), match='o'>
<re.Match object; span=(17, 18), match='o'>
<re.Match object; span=(21, 22), match='u'>
<re.Match object; span=(26, 27), match='o'>
<re.Match object; span=(28, 29), match='e'>
<re.Match object; span=(33, 34), match='e'>
<re.Match object; span=(36, 37), match='a'>
<re.Match object; span=(41, 42), match='o'>
# Counts: For instance, two or more consecutive vowels:
two_or_more_vowels = vowels + '{2,}'
print(f"Pattern: {two_or_more_vowels}")
print(re.findall(two_or_more_vowels, input_string))
Pattern: [aeiou]{2,}
['ui']
# Wildcards
cats = "ca+t"
print(re.search(cats, "is this a ct?"))
print(re.search(cats, "how about this cat?"))
print(re.search(cats, "and this one: caaaaat, yes or no?"))
None
<re.Match object; span=(15, 18), match='cat'>
<re.Match object; span=(14, 21), match='caaaaat'>
# Special operator: "or"
adjectives = "lazy|brown"
print(f"Scanning `{input_string}` for adjectives, `{adjectives}`:")
for match_adjective in re.finditer(adjectives, input_string):
    print(match_adjective)
Scanning `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` for adjectives, `lazy|brown`:
<re.Match object; span=(10, 15), match='brown'>
<re.Match object; span=(35, 39), match='lazy'>
# Predefined character classes
three_digits = '\d\d\d'
print(re.findall(three_digits, "My number is 555-123-4567"))
['555', '123', '456']
In the previous example, notice that the pattern search proceeds from left-to-right and does not return overlaps: here, the matcher returns 456 but not 567. In fact, this case is an instance of the default greedy behavior of the matcher.

The backslash plague. In the "three-digits" example, we used the predefined metacharacter class, '\d', to match slashes. But what if you want to match a literal slash? The HOWTO describes how things can get out of control in its subsection on "The Backslash Plague", which occurs because the Python interpreter processes backslashes in string literals (e.g., so that \t expands to a tab character and \n to a newline) while the regular expression processor also gives backslashes meaning (e.g., so that \d is a digit metaclass).

For example, suppose you want to look for the text string, \section, in some input string. Which of the following will match it? Recall that \s is a predefined metacharacter class that matches any whitespace character.

input_with_slash_section = "This string contains `\section`, which we would like to match."

print(f"Searching: {input_with_slash_section}")

print(re.search("\section", input_with_slash_section))
print(re.search("\\section", input_with_slash_section))
print(re.search("\\\\section", input_with_slash_section))
Searching: This string contains `\section`, which we would like to match.
None
None
<re.Match object; span=(22, 30), match='\\section'>
To help mitigate this case, Python provides a special type of string called a raw string, which is a string literal prefixed by the letter r. For such strings, the Python interpreter will not process the backslash.

Although the interpreter won't process the backslash, the regular expression processor will do so. As such, the pattern string still needs two slashes, as shown below.

print(re.search(r"\section", input_with_slash_section))
print(re.search(r"\\section", input_with_slash_section))
print(re.search(r"\\\\section", input_with_slash_section))
None
<re.Match object; span=(22, 30), match='\\section'>
None
Indeed, it is common style to always use raw strings for regular expression patterns, as we'll do in the examples that follow.

Creating pattern groups. Another handy construct are pattern groups, as we show in the next code cell.

Suppose we have a string that we know contains a name of the form, "(first) (middle) (last)", where the middle name is optional. We can use pattern groups to isolate each component of the name and tag the middle name as optional using the "zero-or-one" metacharacter, '?'.

The group itself is a subpattern enclosed within parentheses. When a match is found, we can extract the groups by calling .groups() on the match object, which returns a tuple of all matched groups.

To make this pattern more readable, we have also used Python's multiline string literal combined with the re.VERBOSE option, which then allows us to include whitespace and comments as part of the pattern string.

# Make the expression more readable with a re.VERBOSE pattern
re_names2 = re.compile(r'''^              # Beginning of string
                           ([a-zA-Z]+)    # First name
                           \s+            # At least one space
                           ([a-zA-Z]+\s)? # Optional middle name
                           ([a-zA-Z]+)    # Last name
                           $              # End of string
                        ''',
                        re.VERBOSE)
print(re_names2.match('Rich Vuduc').groups())
print(re_names2.match('Rich S Vuduc').groups())
print(re_names2.match('Rich Salamander Vuduc').groups())
('Rich', None, 'Vuduc')
('Rich', 'S ', 'Vuduc')
('Rich', 'Salamander ', 'Vuduc')
Tagging pattern groups. You can also name pattern groups, which helps make your extraction code a bit more readable.

# Named groups
re_names3 = re.compile(r'''^
                           (?P<first>[a-zA-Z]+)
                           \s
                           (?P<middle>[a-zA-Z]+\s)?
                           \s*
                           (?P<last>[a-zA-Z]+)
                           $
                        ''',
                        re.VERBOSE)
print(re_names3.match('Rich Vuduc').group('first'))
print(re_names3.match('Rich S Vuduc').group('middle'))
print(re_names3.match('Rich Salamander Vuduc').group('last'))

A regular expression debugger. Regular expressions can be tough to write and debug, but thankfully, there are several online tools to help! See, for instance, regex101, pythex, regexr, or debuggex. These all allow you to supply some sample input text and test what your pattern does in real time.

Email addresses
In the next exercise, you'll apply what you've read and learned about regular expressions to build a pattern matcher for email addresses. Again, if you haven't looked through the HOWTO yet, take a moment to do that!

Although there is a formal specification of what constitutes a valid email address, for this exercise, let's use the following simplified rules.

We will restrict our attention to ASCII addresses and ignore Unicode. If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it---you shouldn't need to do anything special given our code templates, below.
An email address has two parts, the username and the domain name. These are separated by an @ character.
A username must begin with an alphabetic character. It may be followed by any number of additional alphanumeric characters or any of the following special characters: . (period), - (hyphen), _ (underscore), or + (plus).
A domain name must end with an alphabetic character. It may consist of any of the following characters: alphanumeric characters, . (period), - (hyphen), or _ (underscore).
Alphabetic characters may be uppercase or lowercase.
No whitespace characters are allowed.
Valid domain names usually have additional restrictions, e.g., there are a limited number of endings, such as .com, .edu, and so on. However, for this exercise you may ignore this fact.

Exercise 1 (2 points). Write a function parse_email that, given an email address s, returns a tuple, (user-id, domain) corresponding to the user name and domain name.

For instance, given richie@cc.gatech.edu it should return ('richie', 'cc.gatech.edu').

Your function should parse the email only if it exactly matches the email specification. For example, if there are leading or trailing spaces, the function should not match those. See the test cases for examples.

If the input is not a valid email address, the function should raise a ValueError.

The requirement, "raise a ValueError" refers to a technique for handling errors in a program known as exception handling. The Python documentation covers exceptions in more detail, including raising ValueError objects.

def parse_email (s):
    email_full = s.split('@')
    u = email_full[0]
    d = email_full[1]
    regex = '^[\w+-]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@][\w.-]+[.]\w{2,3}$'
    if (re.search(regex, s)) and not u[0].isdigit():
        return (u, d)
    else:
        raise ValueError
        return
# Test cell: `parse_email_test`

def pass_case(u, d):
    s = u + '@' + d
    msg = "Testing valid email: '{}'".format(s)
    print(msg)
    assert parse_email(s) == (u, d), msg
    
pass_case('richie', 'cc.gatech.edu')
pass_case('bertha_hugely', 'sampson.edu')
pass_case('JKRowling', 'Huge-Books.org')
pass_case('what-do-you-know+not-much', 'gmail.com')

def fail_case(s):
    msg = "Testing invalid email: '{}'".format(s)
    print(msg)
    try:
        parse_email(s)
    except ValueError:
        print("==> Correctly throws an exception!")
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Should have, but did not, throw an exception!")
        
fail_case('x @hpcgarage.org')
fail_case('   quiggy.smith38x@gmail.com')
fail_case('richie@cc.gatech.edu  ')
fail_case('4test@gmail.com')
fail_case('richie@cc.gatech.edu7')
Testing valid email: 'richie@cc.gatech.edu'
Testing valid email: 'bertha_hugely@sampson.edu'
Testing valid email: 'JKRowling@Huge-Books.org'
Testing valid email: 'what-do-you-know+not-much@gmail.com'
Testing invalid email: 'x @hpcgarage.org'
==> Correctly throws an exception!
Testing invalid email: '   quiggy.smith38x@gmail.com'
==> Correctly throws an exception!
Testing invalid email: 'richie@cc.gatech.edu  '
==> Correctly throws an exception!
Testing invalid email: '4test@gmail.com'
==> Correctly throws an exception!
Testing invalid email: 'richie@cc.gatech.edu7'
==> Correctly throws an exception!
Phone numbers
Exercise 2 (2 points). Write a function to parse US phone numbers written in the canonical "(404) 555-1212" format, i.e., a three-digit area code enclosed in parentheses followed by a seven-digit local number in three-hyphen-four digit format. It should also ignore all leading and trailing spaces, as well as any spaces that appear between the area code and local numbers. However, it should not accept any spaces in the area code (e.g., in '(404)') nor should it in the seven-digit local number.

For example, these would be considered valid phone number strings:

'(404) 121-2121'
    '(404)121-2121     '
    '   (404)      121-2121'
By contrast, these should be rejected:

'404-121-2121'
    '(404)555 -1212'
    ' ( 404)121-2121'
    '(abc) 555-12i2'
It should return a triple of strings, (area_code, first_three, last_four).

If the input is not a valid phone number, it should raise a ValueError.

def parse_phone1 (s):
    regex = '^[\s]*(\+\d{1,2}\s)?\(?\d{3}\)[\s]*\d{3}[\s.-]\d{4}[\s]*$'
    if (re.search(regex, s)):
        phone_split = s.split(")")
        part1_str = ''
        part1 = re.findall('\d+', phone_split[0])
        part1_str = part1_str.join(part1)
        phone_split_1 = phone_split[1].split("-")
        part2 = phone_split[1].split("-")
        return(part1_str,part2[0].strip(),part2[1].strip())
    else:
        raise ValueError
        return
# Test cell: `parse_phone1_test`

def rand_spaces(m=5):
    from random import randint
    return ' ' * randint(0, m)

def asm_phone(a, l, r):
    return rand_spaces() + '(' + a + ')' + rand_spaces() + l + '-' + r + rand_spaces()

def gen_digits(k):
    from random import choice # 3.5 compatible; 3.6 has `choices()`
    DIGITS = '0123456789'
    return ''.join([choice(DIGITS) for _ in range(k)])

def pass_phone(p=None, a=None, l=None, r=None):
    if p is None:
        a = gen_digits(3)
        l = gen_digits(3)
        r = gen_digits(4)
        p = asm_phone(a, l, r)
    else:
        assert a is not None and l is not None and r is not None, "Need to supply sample solution."
    msg = "Should pass: '{}'".format(p)
    print(msg)
    p_you = parse_phone1(p)
    assert p_you == (a, l, r), "Got {} instead of ('{}', '{}', '{}')".format(p_you, a, l, r)
    
def fail_phone(s):
    msg = "Should fail: '{}'".format(s)
    print(msg)
    try:
        p_you = parse_phone1(s)
    except ValueError:
        print("==> Correctly throws an exception.")
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Failed to throw a `ValueError` exception!")

Should pass: '     (453)     354-4327'
Should fail: '404-121-2121'
==> Correctly throws an exception.
Should fail: '(404)555 -1212'
==> Correctly throws an exception.
Should fail: ' ( 404)121-2121'
==> Correctly throws an exception.
Should fail: '(abc) 555-1212'
==> Correctly throws an exception.
Should fail: '(678) 555-12i2'
==> Correctly throws an exception.
Exercise 3 (3 points). Implement an enhanced phone number parser that can handle any of these patterns.

(404) 555-1212
(404) 5551212
404-555-1212
404-5551212
404555-1212
4045551212
As before, it should not be sensitive to leading or trailing spaces. Also, for the patterns in which the area code is enclosed in parentheses, it should not be sensitive to the number of spaces separating the area code from the remainder of the number.
